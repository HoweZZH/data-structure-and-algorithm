Database Management Systems Versus File Management Systems

__Database Management System__
A Database Management System (DMS) is a combination of computer software, hardware, and information designed to electronically manipulate data via computer processing. 

Two types of database management systems are DBMS’s and FMS’s. 

In simple terms, a File Management System (FMS) is a Database Management System that allows access to __single files__ or __tables__ at a time. FMS’s accommodate flat files that have no relation to other files. 

Database Management System (DBMS) allows access to __multiple files__ or __tables__ at a time.
