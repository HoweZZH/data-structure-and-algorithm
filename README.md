#### merge sort
merge-sort is ideally suited for very large data sets, which must be accessed on a hard drive or network storage
system.

#### quick sort
quick-sort, is very efficient for moderately large data sets that fit in the computer’s main memory (RAM).

#### Method overloading 
Method overloading means making multiple versions of a function based on the input type or the number of arguments).

Method overloading is __static polymorphism__(calls to overloaded methods are realized at __compile time__).

When overriding a method, you might want to use the __@Override__ annotation that instructs the compiler that you intend to override a method in the superclass. If, for some reason, the __compiler__ detects that the method does not exist in one of the superclasses, then it will generate an error. For more information on @Override, see [Annotations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/index.html).

#### Method Overriding__

Method Overriding means defining a new version of the 
method by a subclass of the original.

Overriding is __runtime polymorphism__ (Calls to overridden methods are realized at __run-time__, based on the type on which the method is invoked).
